## **Inventory Management System (CLI-based)**

**Concept**: Build a command-line inventory management system for a small retail store that manages products using file-based storage.
**Core Features:**
There are two kinds of users[Roles] in this system -
ADMIN (Who can perform all actions)
READERS (Who can only read)

## Product CRUD Operations:

**Create**: Add new products with details (ID, name, category, price, quantity, supplier, etc.)

**Read**:

- View all products
- Search by ID, name, category
- Filter products (low stock, by price range, by category)

**Update**: Modify product details, update stock quantity
**Delete**: Remove products (with confirmation)
